        <h2>INLINE STYLING.</h2>
        <div>
        <h4>Advantages</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Specificity: Inline styles have the highest level of specificity, which means they can easily override any other styles applied to the element.</li>
            <li>Convenience: Inline styles are convenient for making quick, specific changes to indiviual elements without affecting the rest of the document.</li>
            <li>Portability: When copying and pasting HTML elements, inline styles are carried along with the element, making it easier to maintain the styling.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>maintainance: Inline styles can make the HTML document harder to maintain, as styles are mixed with the content and not centralized in a seperate stylesheet.</li>
        <li>Readability: Large amounts of inline styles can make the HTML code less readable and harder to understand.</li>
        <li>Reusability: Inline styles cannot be reused across multiple elements, leading to redundant code and increased file sizes.</li>
    </ol>

        <h2>INTERNAL STYLING.</h2>
        <div>
        <h4>Advantages</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Internal CSS has higher specificity than external CSS, which allows you to override external styles more easily within the same HTML file.</li>
            <li>Internal CSS reduces HTTP requests, enhancing performance.</li>
            <li>Internal CSS is relatively easy to implement we can use class and id selectors in this stylesheet.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
        <ol>

        <h2>EXTERNAL STYLING.</h2>
        <div>
        <h4>Advantages</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>With the help of External Style sheets, the styles of numerous documents can be organized from one single file.</li>
            <li>In External Style Sheets, classes can be made for use on numerous HTML element types in many forms of the site.</li>
            <li>In complex contexts, methods like selector and grouping can be implemented to apply styles.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
        <ol>
        <li>An extra download is essential to import style information for each file.</li>
        <li>The execution of the file may be deferred till the external style sheet is loaded.</li>
        <li>While implementing styel sheets, we need to test Web pages with multiple browsers in order to check compatibility issues.</li>
    </ol>
